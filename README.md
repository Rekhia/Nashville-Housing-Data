# Cleaning the Nashville Housing Data involves a series of steps to prepare the dataset for analysis. These steps ensure the data is accurate, consistent, and properly formatted. Below is an overview of the key tasks typically performed during the data cleaning process:
1. Standardizing Column Names
      Action: Rename columns to have consistent and descriptive names.
2. Handling Missing or Null Values
      Action: Identify columns with missing values and handle them appropriately.
      Replace NULL values with defaults (e.g., 0 for numerical columns or Unknown for text).
      Remove rows where critical data is missing, if necessary.
      Converting Data Types
3. Converting Data Types
      Action: Ensure columns have appropriate data types for analysis.
      Convert date columns stored as text into DATE format.
      Convert VARCHAR fields like 'YES' and 'NO' into BIT values (1 and 0).
4. Splitting or Parsing Columns
      Action: Separate concatenated data into distinct columns for better analysis.
      Example: Split the PropertyAddress column into StreetNumber and StreetName
5. Removing Duplicates
      Action: Identify and remove duplicate rows to avoid skewed results.
6. Handling Inconsistent Data
      Action: Fix inconsistent formatting in columns like text, case, or special characters.
      Example:
      Standardize text to title case.
      Remove leading or trailing spaces:
7. Dropping Unnecessary Columns
      Action: Remove columns that are irrelevant or redundant.
